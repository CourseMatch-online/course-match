# CourseMatch
### *python, Discord, react, Firebase, next.js*
#### *with the help of React Rainbow, Node Mailer, and more.*
Course Match is a secure online platform where students can join using their university transcripts and email to be placed in discord channels with other students taking the same courses. Course Match provide students with the opportunity to make friends and start conversation with those who would be sitting right next to them if not for the pandemic. We aim to bring students closer in a somewhat broken world.

Leveraging the familiar environment of discord and the security of our verification system, course match gives students in each cohort a great platform to meet and mingle.
